<p>"The thing is, I don't even fully trust her myself, no one does," Emela explained, sighing. </p>

<p>"So she could be working with Cecelia?" </p>

<p>"No, I think she hates everyone. She's one of the more… distant angels, she is the angel of envy after all. She kind of hates everyone." </p>

<p>"Did I make the wrong choice then?" </p>

<p>"I wouldn't say so, it's just, she's very judgmental, which isn't always a bad thing. She's quick to figure you out as a person, even when someone hasn't figured out themself." </p>

<p>"So when can I meet her?" </p>

<p>"Normally I would say tomorrow since I guess today has been crazy for you, only just discovering all of this but she only comes into material realm at the dead of the night and she likes playing in the rain so no doubt she'll be out tonight." </p>

<h2><center>* * *</center></h2>

<p>This was just getting too weird for Quin, everything was going so fast and it felt as if his head was turning inside out. Earlier today he was trying to end his life and now he was walking down a wet street with a celestial being in search of another one. </p>

<p>Rain water dripped down from the buildings and the street hadn't any light, making it dark and slippery. Quin held onto Emela's arm so as to not trip and fall. In the middle of the narrow street stood a girl but it was too dark for Quin to make out any features of her. The girl sighed as she stepped into an even darker corner, clearly not wanting to be seen by either Quin or Emela.</p> 

<p>"I found him, Livia," Emela said with a slightly commanding tone. </p>

<p>"I would have found him first but I was a little preoccupied, oh well, I guess I'll have to give this one to you," the girl replied, sighing. </p>

<p>"Are you going to come out of the dark or are you just going to hide like you always do?" </p>

<p>"I think I'll hide for now. So, are you going to introduce the boy to me?" </p>

<p>Emela took a step behind Quin, pushing him more toward the girl. </p>

<p>"So I take it you're the reason Cataline started this whole mess?" She asked, taking a step toward Quin. </p>

<p>"I don't know." </p>

<p>"You're shy, aren't you?" </p>

<p>"Yeah." </p>

<p>"Nervous too?" </p>

<p>Quin remained silent, wondering what the point of meeting this girl even was and why he hadn't just gone to sleep. He looked back to Emela, who was just standing there, lifelessly. </p>

<p>"I suppose you're here too look for some answers huh?"</p>

<p>"What even is this war? Why am I needed?" </p>

<p>"Because you have some of Cataline's celestial energy within you, have the the capability of becoming quite powerful, and you have a link to god." </p>

<p>"And you angels don't have a link to god?" </p>

<p>Livia sighed. </p>

<p>"We don't talk about that," she said, jokingly. </p>

<p>Quin took a step closer to Livia so he could see what she looked like but before he could even place his foot on the ground, she turned around. </p>

<p>"Wh- why don't we go for a walk?" Livia stuttered, her voice sounding nervous. </p>

<p>"Why doesn't she want to show me her face?" Quin asked himself. "Is she too scared to show it?" </p>

<p>Livia started walking along the street, turning back slightly, gesturing at Quin and Emela to follow her before continuing on her path. </p>

<p>"You know, I've always liked this street, there's nothing to light it up so no one can see me." </p>

<p>"Why don't you like being seen?" Quin asked. </p>

<p>"Because she likes playing alone in the dark and she doesn't want anyone else to see her, she's very self conscious you know." </p>

<p>Livia tsked, her face collapsing into her hands. </p>

<p>"Where are you taking us, Livia?" Emela asked frustratedly. </p>

<p>"Oh, nowhere, I just wanted to go for a little walk, that's all." </p>

<p>After that, no one said anything. They just silently walked through the narrow streets before approaching a more busy road. Livia stood still, not wanting to step away from the shadow of the dark streets they had just been walking through and into the road lined with street lamps. </p>

<p>As Quin and Emela moved closer to Livia, she took a deep breath, standing into the light. She looked up, noticing a figure standing under a street lamp, smirking back at her. She stopped, waiting for Quin and Emela to catch up. </p>

<p>"Shit…" </p>

<p>"Huh? What is it, Livia?"</p>

<p>"Her." </p>

<p>Livia pointed at the person standing underneath the light, taking a step behind Emela. </p>

<p>"Fyla?" </p>

<p>The figure took a step toward them, grinning.</p>

<p>"Awwwww you beat me to him, that's no fun. Here I was thinking I would get to him before anyone else," Fyla said, taking a step toward Quin. </p>

<p>Livia grabbed Quin by the neck, pulling a long, narrow dagger out of her jacket and pointing it at Quin’s throat. </p>

<p>“What the fuck are you doing Livia!?!?!?” Screamed Emela, moving her body into a fighting stance. </p>

<p>“If you take a step closer Fyla, I’ll do it, I’ll kill the human and then you’d have to fight both Emela and I, you might be stronger than us individually but combined, you’ll be joining Cataline.” </p>

<p>“I know you’re lying Livy, you might act like a recluse who hates everyone but I know you aren’t capable of that.” </p>

<p>“Don’t call me that!” </p>

<p>Enraged, Livia turned the knife into the side of Quin’s neck, stabbing in just slightly, only feeling like a pin prick and not drawing any blood. </p>

<p>“Oh, did I anger you Livy?” </p>

<p>Livia bit her lip gently twisting the knife inside Quin’s neck, blood starting to run down. </p>

<p>“Let go of me!” </p>

<p>Livia pushed the knife in a little deeper, letting Quin know that his request would be ignored. </p>

<p>“Fyla, return to the Angelic Realm this instant or you’ll be taking the human’s corpse back to Cecelia for her to use as a trinket.” </p>

<p>Fyla laughed, turning around. </p>

<p>“You’re so funny Livy,” Fyla said, quietly. </p>

<p>A purple glow began to rise from the ground engulfing Fyla. Livia let go of Quin and by the time he had worked out what was going on, Fyla was nowhere to be seen. </p>

<p>“What the fuck was that for!?” Quin said, turning toward Livia, who quickly turned away before Quin could see her face. </p>

<p>“I’m sorry. It- It was all I could think of, I couldn’t let her get near you.” </p>

<p>“Why not?” </p>

<p>“Because she’s working with the angel who killed Cataline, she only wants to take you and brainwash you.” </p>

<p>Quin froze, finding himself surrounded by rage. </p>

<p>“Look me in the eye and tell me you’re sorry, so I know you mean it.” </p>

<p>Livia sighed, realising she would finally have to show her face to Quin and when she did, Quin was speechless. He had imagined the face of a girl who looked confident and egotistic but instead before him stood a girl who looked scared and unsure. </p>

<p>"Quin, I promise I wasn't going to hurt you and I promise I'll make it up to you." </p>

<p>Livia took a step toward Quin, placing her hand on the cut on his neck. </p>

<p>"Dzulé flén."</p>

<p>Quin had absolutely no idea what Livia had just said, it was something in a language he hadn't heard before, but as she muttered these words, green light sparked out of her hand, seemingly closing up the cuts on Quin's neck. </p>

<p>"Does it still hurt?" </p>

"No." </p>

<p>Livia took a step toward Emela, once again hiding her face. </p>

<p>"Livia, what was going through your mind when you decided to take Quin hostage?" </p>

<p>"Are you still mad about that? I was the one who got Fyla to leave okay?" </p>

<p>Emela paused for a second before sighing, Livia wasn't wrong after all. </p>
 
<p>"I'm done with this. I need to return to the angelic realm soon anyway," Emela said, sounding as if she were about to fall asleep. "Do you want me to take you back home Quin or is it okay if Livia takes care of you?" </p>

<p><a href="Four|a.html">"Can you take me home Emela?"</a></p>

<p><a href="Four|b.html">"It's fine if Livia takes me home."</a></p>
