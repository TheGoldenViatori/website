<h1>Chapter Two - b </h1>
<p>"What if she's after me?" Quin thought as he locked the front door of his house. Over the last week, he had become increasingly paranoid, always convinced that someone was watching him or that he was being followed. </p>

<p>Today was no different. After collecting groceries from the store, Quin was certain someone was behind him. Of course, every time he looked, no one was behind him but he still decided to take a different route home, just in case. The street he took this time wasn't a road he had ever been down before and it was unlike the other streets in the city. It was narrow and secluded with trees growing on either side, creating a thick canopy above. </p>

<p>The street was lined with restaurants and rather peculiar shops selling items that one wouldn’t normally be looking for. One of these stores in particular piqued Quin’s curiosity, a weapon store. Quin knew he had no need for any sort of weapon although a part of him felt as if he did. Quite frankly he was unsure how this store still existed. The store was filled with racks containing spears, daggers, knives, axes, darts and other such things. What Quin was really interested in was what lay at the back of the store, swords.</p>

<p>Quin had spent much of his free time in high school studying martial arts and while he was by no means an expert, he had become fairly competent in it. Part of his study had involved swords so it wasn’t as if he was some idiot swinging a sharp piece of metal around.</p>

<p>He picked up a sword which was about seventy centimetres in length. The guard was a golden colour and weaved around the grip. Quin knew it was something he couldn’t afford but decided to just buy it anyway. He felt weird walking through the street just carrying a sword, ready for someone to just come out and arrest him any second. At the end of the street he could see a park adjacent to a busy road. </p>

<p>He decided to take the sword there to give it a swing, just as an idiot who had just bought a sword would. As Quin walked through the park, he noticed an empty underpass and decided it would be a perfect spot to test the sword. Once there he snapped back into reality, starting to feel like he was being watched again. For the next half an hour, Quin tried out his new sword, slowly starting to regain the memories of how to use it, although he still didn’t feel secure. He was ready for someone to just appear out of nowhere and try to harm him. </p>

<p>“You know, you’ll just hurt yourself if you keep doing that,” a girl's voice called out. The voice sounded as if it had come from behind Quin and it echoed through the underpass but no one was there. </p>

<p>He swung the sword behind him, a slicing sound following, even though nothing was there. Quin started to freak out. Had he just killed someone? No. He couldn’t have no one was there, although it felt as if he had cut into something. He looked down for a second, placing the sword on the ground. As he looked up, a girl was standing before him. She was the same height as Quin, her hair was purple and she wore a short black dress. The look on her face was one of arrogance, as if she knew exactly what was about to happen and she was somehow a better person for that. </p>

<p>“That was close,” she said in a disdainful voice. “You almost cut me right in half.” </p>

<p>She giggled as she took a step forward, picking up the sword on the ground. </p>

<p>“Now, how would you feel if I cut you in half Quin?” </p>

<p>She pointed the sword toward Quin, forcing him to step back toward the wall. </p>

<p>“I’m just kidding.” </p>

<p>Quin just stood there, completely speechless. </p>

<p>"How did you know my name?" </p>

<p>"I know everything about you Quin." </p>

<p>The girl walked right up to Quin and grabbed onto his arm, wrapping herself around it.</p>

<p>"Your arm is so soft, it would be fun to cut into your arm with it." The girl paused for a second, a look of regret forming on her face. "Sadly I'm not allowed to hurt you, not that I wanted to hurt you of course, I could never hurt you Quin." </p>

<p>"Who are you?" </p>

<p>"I'm an Angel of course." </p>

<p>"I'm sorry what…?" </p>

<p>"I'll introduce myself properly for you Quin. I'm Fyla, The Angel of Anticipation, don't question it, just accept it as fact." </p>

<p>"Have you been following me this entire time?" </p>

<p>"Of course I have, for many months I've been keeping an eye on you, waiting for the right time to reveal myself." </p>

<p>Quin snatched the sword out of Fyla's hand and took a step back, pointing it at her. </p>

<p>"The only thing that can kill an angel is another angel so I suggest you stop pointing that toy at me before I kill you." </p>

<p>"You said you would never hurt me."</p>

<p>"Of course I won't Quin, I'll protect you forever and ever!" </p>

<p>Quin was already starting to get sick of this girl, she was annoying and the idea that she 'knew everything about him' also made him uneasy. He didn't even know who she was or what she wanted. </p>

<p>"Protect me from what?" </p>

<p>"The other angels of course." </p>

<p>"And why would they want to hurt me?" </p>

<p>"Because there's a war between all of the angels right now and some of them are trying to rebel against the rest of us." </p>

<p>"Rebel? Why?" </p>

<p>"Let's just say, they've forgotten what it means to be an angel." </p>

<p>Fyla grabbed onto Quin's arm again, he tried to snatch his arm away but she would not let go. </p>

<p>"Awww, don't be like that Quin." </p>

<p>"Why are you so annoying?" </p>

<p>Fyla frowned, letting go of Quin's arm. </p>

<p>"So, when do I get to go to your house?" </p>

<p>"You aren't." </p>

<p>"I'm just going to follow you home anyway."</p>

<p>"Don't care, you aren't coming into my house." </p>

<p>"I'll tell you all about the war, surely you want to hear about that, right?" </p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Fyla sat down at Quin's table, constantly fidgeting in her seat, meanwhile Quin was in the kitchen, making some tea for his guest. </p>

<p>"This is so exciting, I finally get to be in your house!" Fyla exclaimed, her voice clearly conveying her excitement.</p>

<p>"Please, stop yelling." </p>

<p>"You're really no fun are you Quin? Don't you ever get bored?" </p>

<p>"All the time," Quin responded sarcastically.  </p>

<p>Quin sat down at the table, placing a mug in front of Fyla. She smiled at him and picked it up, slurping loudly as she drank from it. </p>

<p>"If you spill it, I will kill you." </p>

<p>"Quin, we've been over this, that's not a way to speak to a divine being who is superior to you in every way and can smite you whenever she wants." </p>

<p>"You told me you were going to tell me about this war, so please, tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Can I at least finish my tea?" </p>

<p>Quin shot Fyla a look of anger, "No you can't" it said. </p>

<p>"Fine, fine." </p>

<p>Fyla took one last sip before slamming the mug onto the table. </p>

<p>"There was this one angel who was always hard to work with. She was unreliable and self-absorbed, going so far as to defy orders made by God. She decided one day that she wanted to see what it was like to live as a human and gave up her angelic power to be able to stay indefinitely in the material realm. You see, us angels can only spend so long in this world before we're forced to return to our world; however by renouncing our angelic powers, we can stay here forever, or at least until we die here. Do you follow?" </p>

<p>Quin nodded his head, although he still had some questions. </p>

<p>"Unsurprisingly, the angel who decided to do this was The Angel of Curiosity and after years of her living like a human, the angelic realm became more unstable, with many defending her actions. Eventually an angel by the name of Cecilia finally ended it by finding her and killing her. Even though balance had been restored to our world, other angles labelled Cecelia as an angel murderer and started a rebellion against her." </p>

<p>"What does this have to do with me? </p>

<p>"Well, you were quite close to The Angel of Curiosity." </p>

<p>It took Quin a few seconds before he knew whom Fyla was talking about but it clicked, he was beyond shocked. </p>

<p>"Cataline?!?!?! She was an angel?!?!?!" </p>

<p>"Yes, she was." </p>

<p>Quin collapsed onto the table, his head about to explode. Fyla patted him on the head but this failed to make him feel any better. </p>

<p>"So you're on the same side as the angel who killed my girlfriend?" </p>

<p>"Yes but, we aren't the bad ones in this situation, they are. Cataline decided that rather than be an angel, she would be a sort of succubus instead." </p>

<p>"And there are other angels after me? </p>

<p>"That's right." </p>

<p>"And do you promise to protect me?" </p>

<p>"Of course I do Quin." </p>

<p>"Ugh… This is so confusing." </p>

<p>"I'm sure it is… Now, I have a question for you Quin." </p>

<p>"Oh?" </p>

<p>"Do you love me? </p>

<p>"What kind of question is that? I don't even know you." </p>

<p>"Awwww you're supposed to say yessssss." </p>

<p>Quin was starting to get a little scared, not only was this girl following him, knew everything about him and asking weird questions, she was also an angel with magic powers. </p>

<p>"So… When are you going to leave my house?" </p>

<p>"Only when you leave, I swore to protect you after all." </p>

<p>"Great…" </p>

<p>Quin stood up from his chair, snatching Fyla's tea from the table and taking it to the sink.</p>

<p>"So will you let me sleep with you Quin?" </p>

<p>Quin sighed and laughed at the same time, he had just about had it with this girl. </p>

<p>"I know you're an angel and all but you can sleep on the couch or on the floor okay?" </p>

<p>"I'm just kidding, I'll be back in the angelic realm unless you need me." </p>

<p>Quin was glad to hear this, he certainly didn't feel comfortable with random people in his house, especially someone as lively as Fyla.  </p>

<p>"You should be more excited about this Quin, you have formed a contract with an angel after all." </p>

<p>"I think I'll take anything the Angel of Anticipation says about excitement with a grain of salt."  </p>

<p>Quin sat back down in front of Fyla, staring directly into her eyes. He hadn't noticed how pretty she was and for all of her flaws, he could tell that she was genuinely a nice person. </p>

<p>Fyla jumped out of her chair, almost as if her name had been called, and raced toward the front door. </p>

<p>"Fyla what are you doing?" </p>

<p>"There's another angel in our presence and I don't think she's a friend. You should stay inside." </p>

<p>"Let me come with you." </p>

<p>"No Quin, you'll just get hurt and you wouldn't be much help to me anyway."</p>

<p>Quin was slightly offended by this comment even though she was right. </p>

<p>"What are you going to do to her?" </p>

<p>"Cecelia said if I have to, I can kill another angel and I'm sure she'll try to kill you first." </p>

<p>"So you're going to kill her?" </p>

<p>"I am." </p>
