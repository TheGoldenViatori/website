<h1>Chatper Three - ab </h1>
<p>“No. You can’t!” Quin yelled, sounding upset. </p>

<p>“Quin… This is going to be hard for you to accept but sometimes we have to do things like this… okay?"</p>

<p>"I'm not letting you Fyla. You can't."</p>

<p>Fyla sighed like a parent who had just lost an argument to a child, rolling her eyes.</p> 

<p>"I don't even know how another angel could have found us, there's a magical barrier around your house."</p>

<p>"A barrier?" </p>

<p>"Yes, angels can create barriers around certain areas to stop other angels from entering and they can't be detected by other angels. It seems Cataline made a barrier around her house and you seem to be programmed into it."</p>

<p>"Programmed into a barrier?" </p>

<p>"What I mean by that is, only angels that the caster lets inside can enter, but anyone you let inside can also enter and the barrier also works to protect you as well." </p>

<p>Fyla opened one of the curtains, looking outside of Quin's house. </p>

<p>"Come with me Quin." </p>

<p>Fyla and Quin walked outside, standing in front of Quin's front gate. Fyla placed her hand in the air, holding it out in front of her. </p>

<p>"Tósu Anek." </p>

<p>Fyla muttered some words to herself in a language Quin had never heard before and as she did, a giant glow appeared, forming the outline of a box around Quin's house. The glow looked like a solid object but seemed somewhat unstable. Cracks loudly began to form in the glow and everything fell to pieces like a glass box crumbling onto itself. </p>

<p>"Uhhh… what just happened…?" Quin asked anxiously. </p>

<p>"I broke the barrier. After examining it, I realised that since Cataline hadn't been putting any energy back into it, the barrier had fallen into disrepair, hence why I was able to break it. An angel can't break another angel's barrier but if the original caster stops feeding it, it becomes vulnerable. I'm going to put a new one up instead and don't worry, I'm going to make it work on you too."</p>

<p>Fyla took a few steps back, holding her hands out flat and pointing them toward the front gate. </p>

<p>“Hédzul nget, tha. Fódz sa. Et Hédzulka nget. Sa téng, tósu. Uftė, Fyla. Sona Quin.”</p>

<p>A giant jet of purple energy sprang out of Fyla's hands, creating a box around Quin's yard. After a few moments, the box became invisible and Fyla lowered her hands. She began hyperventilating and collapsed toward Quin, him quickly grabbing her. She looked up at Quin and smiled. </p>

<p>“You have no idea how much energy that takes Quin. I’m not as competent in these kinds of things compared to the other angels you know.” </p>

<p>Fyla seemed really vulnerable in Quin’s arms and something about that felt cute to Quin. He wasn’t sure why he was having these sorts of feelings towards Fyla, He had only known her for a few hours after all, but something about her felt like Cataline. </p>

<p>“Okay, the barrier has fully formed, let’s just hope the other angel doesn’t find us.” </p>

<p>Fyla began to walk inside, Quin stayed still, staring at the barrier that had now become invisible. As Fyla stepped into Quin's house, she collapsed onto the ground. </p>

<p>"Quinnnnnnn…" Fyla moaned as Quin came to her side, picking her off the floor. </p>

<p>"What's wrong Fyla…?" </p>

<p>"I don't feel so gooddddddd. I think I need to go back to the Angelic Realm and, you need to go to sleep anyway." </p>

<p>"I'm not that tired though." </p>

<p>Fyla rolled her eyes and grabbed Quin's hands, pulling him into his bedroom. They both stood there, awkwardly. Still holding hands. Fyla fell into Quin, wrapping her arms around him. Quin closed his eyes, allowing himself to sink back into Fyla. </p>

<p>"Angels almost never feel cold, but right now I feel freezing, your body kinda makes me feel warm. I never thought a human would be able to do that for me."</p>

<p>Quin opened his eyes again, Fyla nowhere to be seen. His heart started racing and he began to panic. Quin climbed into his bed but found himself unable to sleep, his mind was fixated on Fyla. Before he couldn't wait for her to leave, but now he desperately wanted her to return. He certainly didn't think he would miss Fyla. </p>

<h3><center>* * *</center></h3>

<p>Quin woke up with a warm sensation twirled around his body. He was too tired to open his eyes to actually see what was grabbing him but he had a reasonably certain idea of what was. He wanted to struggle free but he didn't have the energy to and part of him actually enjoyed the feeling. </p>

<p>“F- Fyla…” Quin said, sounding like he had just woken up. </p>

<p>“What is it, Quin?” Fyla responded. </p>

<p>“Why?” </p>

<p>“Would you like me to stop?” </p>

<p>“...” </p>

<p>Fyla stood up and faced the other way, trying to hide her blushing from Quin. </p>

<p>“This is embarasinggggggg,” Fyla squealed, although not loudly. </p>

<p>Quin climbed out of his bed and walked over to Fyla, who hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>“We don’t really know each other, Fyla,” Quin said sternly. </p>

<p>“I know, I know, I just…. Being the Angel of Anticipation and all, I tend to get a little excited sometimes, I can’t really control it.” </p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” </p>

<p>“Being the kind of angel I am, I feel this kind of pulse every second of the day, as if I have to quickly rush into the next second without looking back and… There’s nothing I can do about it. I wish I could enjoy the present, at least once in my life, but ever since I was created, that’s never happened.” </p>

<p>For the first time, Quin found himself feeling sorry for Fyla and he could see the look of regret in her face. But one thing Fyla had said stood out to him, even though it was mostly unrelated to the point. </p>

<p>“How long ago were you created?</p>

<p>“I’m not entirely certain myself. The concept of time as humans imagine it isn't too old, compared to me anyway."</p>

<p>"But I guess you were around for some pretty cool moments in time, right?"</p>

<p>"To be honest with you Quin, I never payed attention to humanity as a whole, only the individuals I was involved with but, like I said before, I was never able to enjoy the moments I spent with them and before the blink of an eye, I would relearn that humans don't live for long at all." </p>

<p>"Did you ever fall in love with a human?" Quin asked, hoping for a certain answer from Fyla. </p>

<p>Fyla sighed, this wasn't a question she had wanted to answer but she had seemingly made it obvious what said answer was. </p>

<p>"The biggest mistake an angel can make is doing that, a mistake I keep making even after swearing I wouldn't. I still remember every single human I married, who I would eventually watch die, even every child I had with those humans, would die too soon for me. I was always too busy being in the Angelic Realm and what not that I didn't have time to be there for them. " </p>

<p>“I-”</p>

<p>"I guess I got a little carried away,” Fyla said, laughing ruefully. “Anyway, let's go somewhere else, I'm hungryyyyyyyy." </p>

<p>Quin had seen a side of Fyla he didn't expect to see, the mature side of her and knowing it existed comforted him but it seemed for the most part, no matter how long she had existed for, she was just a child. </p>

<p>“Angels can get hungry?” Quin asked, confused. </p>

<p>“Mhm, only in the Material Realm though. Not eating won’t kill me but my stomach hurts.”</p>

<p>“So you want me to feed you?” </p>

<p>“I have high standards though.” </p>

<h3><center>* * *</center></h3>
  
<p>Quin didn’t like going out to eat, the loud noises, awkwardly ordering food, people everywhere and then the expenses after the fact, so of course it would be Fyla of all people to drag him into a situation such as this. Quin watched his food on the table, not touching it. </p>

<p>"Aren't you going to eat?" Fyla asked, sipping her coffee. </p>

<p>"Maybe." </p>

<p>"You didn't pay all this money for me to have to finish your food as well, did you Quin?" </p>

<p>Fyla picked up Quin's fork and held it in front of his mouth. She smirked, watching Quin freak out. </p>

<p>"You don't want to swallow it? That's a shame, I thought you'd like getting fed by a cute girl." </p>

<p>Quin rolled his eyes, snatching the fork from Fyla's hands, which by the look on Fyla's face, she didn't expect. He swallowed his food, throwing the fork at Fyla. The fork didn't hit Fyla but instead bounced off the air in front of her. </p>

<p>"Oh you discovered that? It's pretty cool huh?" </p>

<p>"I guess."  </p>

<p>"It's another kind of barrier power I have, but what makes it different to the one I made last night is that my body creates these kinds unconsciously when something comes really fast toward me. Although, the barrier breaks as soon as the object changes trajectory." </p>

<p>Quin picked the fork up and began eating his food, seemingly not caring about what Fyla had to say. Fyla blushed and awkwardly looked down at her food, avoiding eye contact with Quin. All Fyla wanted was for Quin to like him but it didn't seem like their personalities matched up and there wasn't anything she could do about it. She couldn't just pretend to be someone else, by nature she was locked into how she was, even if she wanted to change she couldn't.</p> 

<p>"Hey Quin?" </p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Do you hate me?" </p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. </p>

<p>"It- It's okay if you do, I get why you would." </p>

<p>"I don't hate you Fyla. Why would I?" </p>

<p>"Cuz I'm annoying, I annoy everyone I meet." </p>

<p>"And you're clingy, slightly possessive and very impatient." </p>

<p>Fyla sighed, looking back down at the table with regret.</p>

<p>"But despite all that, I still don't hate you Fyla. You're my only friend right now." </p>

<p>"F- friend? Really? Even though we just met?" </p>

<p>"Of course." </p>

 <h3><center>* * *</center></h3>

<p>Quin and Fyla walked along the promenade, the sun was out and the atmosphere was lively. Fyla charmingly skipped along the edge footpath, the wind from the ocean throwing her long hair into her face. </p>

<p>"Fyla, you're going to fall if you do that." </p>

<p>Fyla laughed, reminding Quin once again that she wasn't a human and thus, it didn't matter if she fell. </p>

  <p><i>"She's just too cute</i>," Quin thought, watching Fyla in awe. "<i>Why am I even thinking this? I just met her. And then there's Cataline…</i>" </p>

<p>Quin tried to block the thoughts out of his head, instead looking at the ocean. </p>

<p>"You know Quin, I try my hardest not to be annoying. I really do." </p>

<p>Fyla stepped into the middle of the footpath, standing still. </p>

<p>"I believe you Fyla." </p>

<p>"Anyway Quin, what do you want to do next?" </p>

<p>"What do you mean?" </p>

<p>"Well, you're kinda caught up in this whole war thing and we need to plan it out." </p>

<p>"Isn't that what that other angel was in charge of?"</p>

<p>"Kind of. It's not like she's the boss of me or anything. She's our leader but we're all still equals." </p>

<p>"So do you want to go around hunting other angels or something?" </p>

<p>"We could do that, unless you want to lay low." </p>
