<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>Curiosity. The strong desire to learn something. Why did she need to have so much of it? Quin watched her as she skipped gracefully down the pavement, admiring almost every plant, flower and garden bed she walked past. </p>

<p>She loved learning and when given the chance to learn something new, she took it. Back in high school, whenever a fight or some sort of drama came up, Cataline would always investigate, flaying back the layers to get every possible detail. Whenever she had the chance to meet a new person she would and when she did, she tried to learn as much as she could about that person. It was how she had met Quin, he certainly wouldn’t have the courage to walk up to a girl as beautiful as her and just start talking.  </p>

<p>Quin called out to Cataline, asking her to wait up. She smiled, walking into a garden bed to admire the flowers.</p>

<p>"Beautiful, don't you think Quin?" She asked as he walked over to her. </p>

<p>"Don't you think it's a bad idea to stand in the garden bed?" </p>

<p>"It's night time, it's not like anyone's gonna see." </p>

<p>"That's not what I meant, Cataline." </p>

<p>Cataline grabbed Quin's hand and pulled his small body into hers, wrapping her arms over his shoulders. Cataline's body gave off rays of warmth, making him feel at ease. </p>

<p>"Your body feels so cold Quin." </p>

<p>"It's okay, I'm fine." </p>

<p>"You'll get sick with that logic and I don't want to see you get sick."</p>

<p>"If I get sick, that's an excuse to sleep a little more." </p>

<p>"Hmmmmm, now you haven't been sleeping a lot lately, I think we should get you into bed." </p>

<p>"It's fine Cataline." </p>

<p>Cataline frowned, looking down at Quin, the wind picking up and the cold air becoming even colder. </p>

<p>"Quin, can you just wait here for a second?" </p>

<p>Quin nodded and found himself a tree to lean on. Cataline walked over to the edge of the park, approaching a figure around the same height as her, wearing a long red dress, although not the kind that made her stand out. </p>

<p>"What do you want, Cecelia?" Cataline yelled aggressively over the howling wind. </p>

<p>"I'm ending your bullshit Cataline. You knew you shouldn't have entered into a relationship with a human. You knew you shouldn't have converted to human form. Everything you’ve done has just made our lives so much harder." </p>

<p>"But I love him, Cecelia." </p>

<p>"Love is disgusting." </p>

<p>"Just leave us alone, this doesn't affect you anyway." </p>

<p>"Oh but it does Cataline and it's not like you can stop me. In your current form, you're completely powerless." </p>

<p>"No. Don't you-" </p>

<p>"You're more useful in the angelic realm than you are here." </p>

<p>Tears started falling from Cataline's eyes, she couldn't win. Cecelia would kill her and she would be trapped in the angelic realm for one hundred years. She looked over at Quin who was still leaning against a tree. She smiled briefly before bursting out into tears. Cataline looked back at Cecelia who was standing there, the expression on her face, disgust. Cecelia thrust her fingers into Catalines chest, blood instantly pouring out everywhere. She let out a scream, which quickly faded as she started to choke on her own blood.</p>
 
<p>Cecelia smiled as she stepped over Cataline's body. She walked on past Quin who was still oblivious as to what had just happened. </p>

<p>"It's a rather nice evening, isn't it?" Cecelia said, looking over at Quin. </p>

<p>"Huh? What do you mean?" Quin responded.</p>

<p>"Oh nothing… I just think it's that kind of night where a lot of things happen, so long as you’re paying attention, that is." </p>

<p>Cecelia continued walking forward, laughing to herself. </p>

<p>Quin didn't have the heart to get rid of the photos, even though he wanted to forget about her. It had been three months since that night, but every morning he woke up feeling like it had happened the night just gone. </p>

<p>One photo in particular always seemed to be looming at him, a photo of him leaning on Cataline's shoulder, taken when they were sixteen. Back then they were young and naïve and Quin would give anything to be like that again. </p>

<p>The corner of his bedroom became his new home. He would spend hours upon hours sulking instead of doing anything meaningful. He had dropped out of school and seldom left his house, only doing so when in need of essential items. </p>

<p>His life had become entirely devoid of meaning. There just wasn't a point anymore. Every day since that night had been the same, almost as if time had frozen.</p>

<p>There were only two options left now. Push through everything or end it once and for all. The former would be hard and he didn't think he had the strength for it. The latter, on the other hand, would be more proactive, quick and easy.</p>
