<h1>Oil & Ice</h1>
Oil & Ice

<p>It had been almost three months since the Quadrant-IV had been reduced to rubble and burned woodlands. Every day Avora wandered through the old streets, if you could call them streets. What was once a paved road had become black dust that had been melted from fire and explosions. There was a strong smell of oil in the air as it had been burnt a lot after the invasion. </p>

<p>Piles of bricks, burnt wooden beams and broken objects that once filled people's houses framed the black dust. Avora would walk around trying to find anyone to talk to. There weren't many people left in the Quadrant-IV. Most of them had been killed in the invasion and the ones that survived either starved, died from disease or were killed in the anarchy that ensued. The Mauvian army had been pushed out of the area but it was hardly worth defending anymore. </p>

<p>Avora had talked to most of the people that remained. However, there was one person she was yet to talk to. There was something about him that seemed... creepy. He would always sit on top of a pile of rubble in an iron chair wearing a notch lapel suit and a hat. He would just stare at the centre of the remaining city, the dusty towers that shot miles into the sky. </p>

<p>When Avora wasn't walking around she would sit in a small garden atop the steep hill and just think. Before the city was destroyed it was a beautiful little spot with all sorts of colourful plants and tall shady trees. She and her boyfriend would sit there together and talk to each other. Now it was a pile of burnt wood lying on hard dirt. During the bombings, all of the topsoil had been blown into the main city making Quadrant-IV seem even eerier and making all the skyscrapers look much older and dustier. </p>

<p>This particular day Avora decided to go to her garden as soon as she woke up. A small shed that had survived the explosions had served as her house for the past two and a half months and it was quite a fair bit away from anything. It was small and she had to sleep on the hard concrete ground. There were no windows and her only light source was a small candle. </p>

<p>As she walked she made small talk with a few people who were growing fruit in front of what used to be the school. Gardening supplies had been salvaged from there, so it was possible to grow a bit of extra food. </p>

<p>After collecting a very unripe orange she continued down the road. She looked in the direction of the city to see the man in the suit, not in his usual place. He was sitting on the edge of the road eating some sort of green fruit. Avora decided she would try to talk to the man for once. She wasn't exactly sure what to say but she knew she would think of something. </p>

<p>"Did they give you a piece of fruit too?" Avora asked the man in her normal friendly voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, they were kind enough to offer me some. I can't say it is the best fruit I have ever tasted, it is quite sour after all, but I can't complain," The man replied in a polite, formal tone. </p>

<p>"I mean, it's better than the rations the army drops over the Quadrant-IV." </p>

<p>"Yes, that is very true."</p>

<p>"It doesn't make sense to me. They'll give us food but they won't let us leave. What's so bad about us?" </p>

<p>"Most would think they would have some sort of good reason but I doubt it. I mean it shan’t be long before they stop giving us food at all." </p>

<p>"Yeah, I haven't planned for that but I probably should." </p>

<p>"As should I," the man said. There was a slightly awkward pause afterwards as Avora couldn't think of anything else to say. She didn't know this man well enough to think of something.</p>

<p>"Well, nice talking to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it was. Have a good day Avora."</p>

<p>Avora walked off confused, how did the man know her name? One of the people growing food at the school must have told him, right? But, how would a conversation lead to that? It’d be rather creepy if he had asked. </p>

<p>As she sat in the garden, she continued thinking about it. Did she know him from somewhere? Eventually, the thought left her head as she started thinking about what the man had said before, what if the army did stop dropping food? They were not growing enough food to live.</p>

<p>The wind picked up and Avora’s long auburn hair started flowing with it. The black dust that once made up the road and the ash from the fires started blowing around with the wind. Avora decided it was time to go back to her “house” before she became covered in black dust. It was already getting caught in her hair and she knew it would be a pain to wash out under the conditions she was in. </p>

<p>The next morning after waking up considerably late she went for her usual walk around Quadrant-IV. It was still breezy so she wore a fur coat which she had salvaged from the wreckage that once was the main shop. However, the wind wasn’t strong and dusty like it had been the previous day. She chatted to different people along the way before making it to the spot where the suited man was seated. She walked up the pile of rubble and stood next to the man. </p>

<p>“Don’t you ever get cold up here?” Avora asked the man. </p>

<p>“Not really, the wind can be annoying, yes but I’m fine,” The man responded. </p>

<p>“I still have a coat and I’m quite cold, I mean Vadra is a cold place.” </p>

<p>“Back in the ‘20s, Vadra was actually quite hot, Although that was back before it was even called Vadra. The towers block all of the sunlight from coming into Quadrant-IV, the other Quadrants are still quite hot.” </p>

<p>“Wish I could go to another quadrant.” </p>

<p>Travel between the Quadrants had been banned since the early 2030s, anyone who made it over the walls was shot almost instantly. </p>

<p>“Yes, It’s been nearly twenty years since I’ve left and I have to say, this has never been the best Quadrant.” </p>

<p>“What were the other Quadrants like?” </p>

<p>“Well, the people there were always much richer than here but apart from that I don’t really remember.” </p>

<p>“Have you always lived in this Quadrant?” </p>

<p>“No, my wife was from this quadrant so I moved here, I was originally from Quadrant-II.” </p>

<p>Quadrant-II had a reputation for being the richest and most built-up quadrant apart from the city’s centre where all the towers were. </p>

<p>“Is there any way to escape?” Avora queried. </p>

<p>“If you were able to get over the walls you might.” </p>

<p>“Hmmm…” </p>

<p>“But they are always guarded, and they can tell where people are from pretty easily?” </p>

<p>“How so?” </p>

<p>“Do you know why there used to always be lavender planted around here?” Avora shook her head. “Each quadrant has a different plant everywhere to give off a strong scent. That way if someone were to jump over they would smell like that plant.”</p>

<p>“So we really are trapped?” </p>

<p>“I’m afraid so.” </p>

<p>“I’ll make it out, I’ll find a way.” </p>
 
<p>“Well, don’t try to do anything stupid okay?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, I won’t!” Avora walked off from the pile of rubble, smiling. Why hadn’t she talked to this man before? If anyone would be able to help her escape it would be him. Over the next few weeks, she talked to the man every day. Sometimes about the situation they were in now and sometimes about other things. The crazy thing was she still didn’t know this man’s name or how he knew hers. </p>

<p>One morning Avora woke up and went to the centre of Quadrant-IV where rations were normally dropped off by the army. There was nothing there. The man was right, they weren’t going to give them food forever. As Avora walked off to her garden she heard bombshells exploding in the distance. The Mauvian army. It had to be them. She knew what was happening, the army had decided that Quadrant-IV wasn’t worth defending anymore.  </p>

<p>Avora went and sat down next to the man in the suit. She couldn’t think of anything to say. She just sat there, mute. </p>

<p>“I’m going to jump over the wall,” Avora mumbled. </p>

<p>“I thought you might say that,” the man replied with a sad tone in his voice. </p>

<p>“I’ll probably die trying but I’ll definitely die if I don’t.” </p>

<p>“There is food here, they’re starting to grow a fair bit of it.” </p>

<p>“Yeah but it’s not enough and I hate it here, it’s just a pile of bricks!” </p>

<p>“What if the other Quadrants are destroyed, what if it is best to stay here where the damage is already done?”</p>

<p>“I’m leaving and that’s that.” </p>

<p>“I’ll go with you then,” the man sighed.</p>

<p>“Huh?” </p>

<p>“I can’t stop you, I may as well go with you.” </p>

<p>“I’m going over tonight, into Quadrant-III.” </p>

<p>“What about the guards?” </p>

<p>Avora pulled a small gun out of her pocket. </p>

<p>“Meet me where the church used to be in five hours.”</p>

<p>She walked off without saying anything else. She seemed serious about it, too serious. Avora started to walk over to her garden, she just wanted to look at it one last time. In the end, she decided against seeing her garden. She just couldn’t bring herself to, too many painful memories. Instead, she decided to go to the spot where she agreed to see the man. Avora peeked over the dark black metal wall. There were about twelve soldiers there so she would have to shoot them all really quick. She didn’t even have enough bullets, she only had eight. </p>

<p>Avora leaned against the wall and thought for a while. She decided she would try to shoot eight in the head and throw some rubble at the other four, that was if she made the first eight shots okay. Avora waited patiently at the wall for the man, she still had a few hours. In the end, she decided to visit her garden one last time. She couldn’t bring herself to do it before but this time she was ready. Once she made it to the garden she sat down and ran her fingers through the hard dirt. She felt something small lodged in it. She looked down to see a small plant pushing through the ground. Such a shame that she was leaving as the garden was growing back. </p>

<p>She started to cry, for the first time she didn’t want to leave Quadrant-IV. It had been her home for fifteen years, it was the only place she had ever known. Yes, it had been destroyed, but the only sign of hope for the place came right when she had to leave. For hours she sat there, tears pouring out. She had to drag herself to the wall. When she made it to the wall the man was waiting for her.</p>

<p>“Are you okay Avora?” the man asked. </p>

<p>“There’s a part of me that’s not ready to leave,” Avora answered. </p>

<p>“Are you sure you want to do this?” </p>

<p>“I’m sure.” There was a slight pause as Avora thought about what to say next. “Why do you always wear that suit?” </p>

<p>The man sighed. </p>

<p>“The day of the attack was when my son was meant to get married, so this is just what I was wearing at the time.” The man looked down to the ground. Avora was speechless. </p>

<p>“I’m sorry about your son.” </p>

<p>“What about you? What did you do on that day?” </p>

<p>“I was in a small garden with my boyfriend, he was shot by the Mauvians trying to save me.” Avora wasn’t able to say that without bursting into tears, the memory was so painful and it was the only thing on her mind. </p>

<p>The man walked up to Avora and hugged her. </p>

<p>“Are you ready?” he asked.</p> 

<p>“I am,” Avora replied. </p>

<p>Avora picked up five bricks and slowly placed them on top of the uneven surface of the wall. She then pulled the small gun out of her pocket. She peaked over the wall and pointed the gun at a soldier's head. BANG! The soldier instantly fell to the ground. As the other soldiers went to see what had happened she shot five more. Two bullets left. The remaining six walked towards the wall, she picked up one of the bricks and threw it at someone. They fell to the ground. She shot the one closest to the wall, but her hand slipped. She ended up shooting them in the foot but they still fell over. Five left. The man leaned over the wall and threw a brick at another soldier. Four left.</p> 

<p>Avora knocked out three more by throwing bricks at them. She shot one more and the last one ran away. She started climbing up the wall. As she got on top she felt this piercing pain in her chest before falling off the wall. </p>

<p>“Avora!” The man yelled as she smashed into the ground. </p>

<p>Avora lay on the hard icy dirt. Blood was pouring out of her, yet she couldn't feel a thing. A part of her was glad it was over, she had lost the will to live. She stared up at the man who was holding her in his arms. She looked up at him, smiling and stroked his chin. She lost the strength to keep her arm up and it collapsed. “I never even learned his name.” Avora thought as her conciseness slowly faded into nothing. </p>
