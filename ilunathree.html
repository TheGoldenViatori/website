<h1>Chapter Three - Composure and Fortitude</h1>
<p>As I walk to school I worry about other people like always. No one can be calm anymore. Whenever anyone feels upset or angry they take it out on others especially me. Whenever I tell them to stop treating me how they are, they make excuses. I once read in a book about psychology, any apology where someone says “I’m sorry but-” Isn’t sincere. “I’m sorry but I feel upset.” “I’m sorry but I’m really stressed” “I’m sorry but I can’t deal with people.” That’s all I hear after someone acts horribly and somehow their excuses justify it, somehow, it’s okay and if I question that I'm the inconsiderate person in this situation.</p>

<p>I’m always upset, I’m always stressed, I’m never in the mood to deal with people but I’m always nice to everyone. Maybe it’s time I withdraw from everyone, for good. I’m too empty to talk to the friends I actually care about, I’m just a burden for them, It’s selfish to stay around them. </p>

<p>At lunch I go to the emptiest part of the school and sit under a tree. I’m the only one here, just how I want it. I grab my book out and start reading, I have nothing else to do. After school I go to my spot in the park and I read my book. I still haven’t said a single word to anyone today. Before I realise it, It’s getting dark. </p>

<p>I get back home and fall onto my bed. I opt to skip dinner and sleep. I feel so tired yet, I can’t sleep. So many thoughts fly in and out of my head. I have all these people I can reach out to but I’m still by myself. </p>

<p>My phone buzzes and I freak out. I always had my phone on silent and only got notifications from one person, my old boyfriend. I haven't talked to him in such a long time. My brain thinks of every possible reason he could be messaging me as I reach for my phone. </p>

<p>"Hey Illuna, You seem really alone, you know I'm here if you need to talk, right?"</p>

<p>I look at my screen with shock. I thought he hated me. He has every reason to after all. I message him back:</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about me, I am fine (=.”</p>

<p>I throw my phone onto my desk, it slides off the otherside, falling to the ground. I then fall into my bed staring up at the ceiling. I at least know that I hate him. </p>
