<h1>Chatper Two - a </h1>
<p>The city Quin lived in was built over a wide river with only a few bridges connecting each side, all of them being large highways. Quin was walking over the bridge closest to the mouth of the river, where it was the widest. It was late at night, so the road wasn't busy, save for all the trucks crossing the bridge. </p>
<p>Quin sat on the railing on the side of the bridge under the cloudy sky. He no longer saw the point in living in a world where she didn't exist. Quin put his hands down by his side, pushing himself off the railing and onto the piece of concrete on the edge of the bridge. As he prepared himself to make the final jump, he felt something grab onto his wrist and tug it back. He looked behind to see what it was, but nothing was there. </p>
<p>He wasn't sure of what grabbed him, but it felt like a soft hand, it's embrace warm. The strangest part was, his hand had moved while he felt the sensation. He either wasn't crazy at all and something really did tug on him or he had achieved a new level of going insane. </p>
<p>Quin wanted to find out what had tugged on his hand, and he couldn't do that if he was dead. He climbed back over the railing, almost slipping off as it was raining ever so slightly, making the metal wet. </p>
<p>Quin looked around. It was just him walking alongside the road on the bridge. He really was insane. The rain started to pick up. It would be too slippery to climb back over the railing now. Quin started walking back in the direction of his house, trying not to slip over the ground, which was completely lined with water. </p>
<p>Tears started to run from his eyes, joining the pool of water on the ground. Everything had become a mess in his life and nothing went the way he wanted it to. He collapsed on his knees, crying even harder. </p>
<p>"What's wrong, Quin?" A soft voice in front of him asked. </p>
<p>Looking up, no one was there. Quin's breathing and heart rate increased as he realised he'd delved deep into insanity. His vision started to become a little more faint as he struggled to get off the ground. The rain became even stronger, each drop almost feeling like a bullet as it landed on him. </p>
<p>"Why don't you talk to me about it, Quin?" The same voice asked again. </p>
<p>Quin opened his mouth to scream, but he was too exhausted to make a sound. The rain in front of him wasn't behaving like rain normally would. It almost looked as if it was bouncing off something. The rain started turning a golden colour as it hit the invisible object and Quin felt the same feeling grabbing his wrist again. Maybe he was dead and this was just some sort of afterlife hallucination. </p>
<p>A figure started to form in front of him. It looked human, but it was hard to make out what exactly it was. It started to become more clear as the rain started to slow. It was a girl. She had long silver hair with strands of blue running through it. Her face was smoother than porcelain and her eyes sparkled like gold. Her hand was gripping onto Quin's and he could feel some kind of surge running through his body and into his heart coming from her soft touch.</p> 
<p>Quin stood there, staring into her eyes. They were more beautiful than the most beautiful sunset. She smiled at him, her face conveying a look of confidence, but a hidden timidity also shone through. </p>
<p>"Who are you?" Quin asked, barely able to form a sentence as he was still succumbing to awe. </p>
<p>"My name is Emela," she smiled, stepping closer to Quin. </p>
<p>"What are you…?" </p>
<p>"Well… This isn't the best place to explain it."</p>
<p>Quin paused for a second, wondering where exactly a better place was… </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Quin let Emela into his small house, quickly closing the door behind him, trying not to let the icy wind inside. He led her to the table in his living room, where she took a seat. Quin sat opposite to the girl, placing his hand underneath his chin and slouching over the table. </p>
<p>"To answer your question, Quin… This is going to sound weird but… I am an angel and not in a figurative sense." </p>
<p>"An angel? You mean they really exist?" </p>
<p>"Well, not in the way most people would imagine them." </p>
<p>"Why did you appear in front of me then?" </p>
<p>"No one knows why, but you're linked to our realm somehow. All of the angels have a connection to you." </p>
<p>"Then, why is it only just now an angel has spoken to me?" </p>
<p>"I'm not the first angel to show herself to you, Quin. She was." </p>
<p>Emela pointed to the table at the edge of the room, placed on top were picture frames, most of them containing photos of Cataline. Quin froze as his brain tried to process what he had been told. </p>
<p>"So… You're telling me that Cataline was an angel…?" </p>
<p>"That's right. Cataline, the Angel of Curiosity." </p>
<p>"Angel of Curiosity?" </p>
<p>"Each of the thirty-two angels represents some sort of emotional concept. So for Cataline, it was curiosity." </p>
<p>This didn't surprise Quin at all, Cataline's curiosity was the most defining part of her personality, often getting her in trouble and other times rewarding her greatly. </p>
<p>"What are you the angel of then?" </p>
<p>"Hope. I am the Angel of Hope." </p>
<p>This explained what the weird sensation was whenever Emela touched Quin. A rush of hope. </p>
<p>"Now, here's the important thing you need to know, Quin. Currently, there's a war between angels. It all started when Cataline decided to give up her spirit form in order to be with you. No doubt, angels from the other faction will soon try to sway you to their side." </p>
<p>"What would they even need me for?" </p>
<p>"Because you aren't just connected to all of the angels, you're connected to God." </p>
<p>"How am I connected to God? I don't even believe in him." </p>
<p>"You sure do ask a lot of questions, don't you Quin? There are thousands of different gods that people worship, but the one true god that rules over the material realm and the angelic realm is worshipped only by the angels. It seems humans have forgotten about him." </p>
<p>Quin gave Emela a look of confusion and exhaustion, Emela just smiled back. It seemed that all she could do was smile. She stood up, pushing her chair back in the table. </p>
<p>"I know that this is a lot for you to take in, so I'll give you some time to take it all in. How does that sound?" </p>
