<h1>Chatper Three - b1 </h1>
<p>“Alright then,” Quin said in a reluctant voice </p>

<p>“You probably don't want to see this Quin.” </p>

<p>“Why not?” </p>

<p>“It's not going to be a pretty fight." </p>

<p>"I'm coming with you Fyla." </p>

<p>Fyla gave a loud sigh before walking right up to Quin. Her pupils shook beneath her corneas. She placed her hands on his shoulders, pushing him away. </p>

<p>"No." </p>

<p>Fyla turned around, sprinting through Quins house and out the door. Quin looked out the window where he saw Fyla holding a sword that looked much like the one Quin had bought that day. Quin looked over to the corner of the room where he had placed the sword earlier. It was gone. His face sank into his hand as he walked out of the door. </p>

<p>He saw Fyla, her knees atop a girl's chest. The girl's silver hair was all over her face, soaked with blood, slowly dripping onto the footpath. Quin could tell she was another angel, she gave off the same aura that Fyla did and Cataline had and it was only now that Quin realised it must have been that aura that attracted him to Cataline. </p>

<p>"I'm not falling for your dumb lies Emela and neither is he!" Fyla yelled aggressively. </p>

<p>The sword she was holding had a purple glow around it, much like the colour of her hair. She pulled the sword above her head before charging at the other angel, sending all the sword's energy into her. The angel let out a jarring shrill, crying loudly. </p>

<p>"Fyla, why are you doing this?!" The angel yelled, still crying on the ground. </p>

<p>"Because we don't need another war!" </p>

<p>"You're just manipulating him, you know that…" </p>

<p>“I… I’m not… I’m just doing what she told me…” </p>

<p>“It’s not right Fyla.” </p>

<p>“SHUT THE FUCK UP EMELA, WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW OF THAT CONCEPT?! JUST- SHUT UP!”</p>

<p>Fyla stood up, raising the sword above her head, ready to stab into the angel, the same purple glow forming again. Quin closed his eyes as he heard a loud, unsettling scream, quickly silenced by the sound of flesh ripping apart. As Quin opened his eyes, he saw the crippled body of the angel Fyla had just killed, it started breaking apart, fading into a purple light. Quin stood still, unsure of how one was supposed to act in a situation such as this. </p>

<p>"Quin, I told you that you wouldn't want to see this." </p>

<p>Fyla walked toward Quin, the expression on her face wasn't one of playfulness like it normally would be, instead it was one of anger. </p>

<p>"What if you were hurt Quin? How do you think that would have gone for you?" </p>

<p>Quin didn't say anything, instead he looked down at Fyla's shoes. Fyla grabbed his hand abrasively, pulling him back toward his house. </p>

<p>"What happened to the angel?" Quin asked. </p>

<p>"I killed her." </p>

<p>Flya opened the door to Quin's house, dragging him towards his bedroom. </p>

<p>"You need to sleep, Quin." </p>

<p>Quin rolled his eyes and grabbed Fyla's shoulders turning her body around so she couldn't see him. Quin slid under his blankets, burying his body underneath so that when Fyla turned back around, she wouldn't be able to see him. The blankets began to move on their own and as Quin opened his eyes, he could see Fyla lying in bed next to him. Quin felt uncomfortable with her being in his bed but before he could say something, she was gone. Quin looked around his room but she wasn't anywhere. </p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>It had to be a dream, right? There was no way that Quin could be caught up in a war between angels or that Cataline was part of it. Well, it was over, everything was back to normal now. </p>

<p>After Quin had woken up, he had a shower. There was an odd purple substance on his body, it felt like dried blood but smelt like salt. Once he had cleaned himself he walked into his living room, where someone else was standing there, smiling at him. It wasn't a dream. </p>

<p>"Good afternoon Quin. You slept for quite some time. Would you like me to make you something to eat?" </p>

<p>"Don't even think about going near my kitchen." </p>

<p>Fyla took a few steps toward Quin, invading his personal space. Quin took a few steps back, trying to resist the urge to hit her. </p>

<p>"Quin, why are you like this?" Fyla asked, frowning at him. </p>

<p>"Like what?" </p>

<p>"You're boring and no fun, just like Cecelia. No one wants to let me have funnnnn." </p>

<p>"Maybe you're just too immature."  </p>

<p>"Maybe you need to meet another one of my angel friends Quin." </p>

<p>"How about not Fyla…" </p>

<p>"Hmmmm, then why don't we go on a date?" </p>

<p>Quin froze. There was something about Fyla that he felt couldn't be trusted and it seemed suspicious that she would ask him on a date but on the other hand, maybe Fyla was just like that, she was the angel of anticipation after all. She just wanted to rush things because she had no patience and she had tried to protect Quin before and she had made a promise, he didn’t think an angel was capable of breaking a promise. </p>

<p><a href="404.htmlp">"I'll meet your other angel friend." </a></p>

<p><a href="404.htmlp">"What kind of date did you have in mind?"</a></p>
