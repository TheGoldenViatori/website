<h1>Not sure what to call this</h1>
<p>The way this works is simple, at the end of each chapter, you'll be given a choice to make, each choice gives you a new chapter and the story branches out. I'm going to have to give you a little spoiler right here and tell you, no matter what choice you make, the main character isn't going to die, so don't worry about making the "wrong" choice. I can't promise that any other character isn't going to die however...</p>
