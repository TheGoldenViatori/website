<h1>Chapter One - Everyone Has Better Friends</h1>
<p>Thin branches of deciduous trees reflect off the murky water. Ducks rest next to the pond, it’s too cold for them to swim. Sitting on the frigid ground leaning against a tree, I go to reach into my pocket to grab my phone, but then I put my hand back down on the ground. It’s too difficult to deal with my friends. They always irritate me, annoy me, the only thing they ever greet me with is “I’m bored” not “Hello” or “How are you?”.</p>

<p>I watch the two ducks sitting at the pond, cuddling each other for warmth, a feeling I wish I could experience. To have someone hold me in the cold, to make me feel warm, inside and out. I turn my head away, watching the ducks is too painful. Instead, I look at a wilting rose, it reminds me of myself. What once was the centrepiece of a beautiful garden is now slowly dying in the cold. I decide to leave the park, everything about it makes me think about the life I came to escape. </p>

<p>No one is outside, it's just me. The vacant streets and the cloudy early morning sky give off a morbid vibe. It’s still dark enough that the street lights are on, although they don't make it much brighter. It's almost as if the dark sky represents all my problems and the dim street lights are my friends. The more I look around the world, the more I am reminded of my life. Everything relates to it somehow. </p>

<p>The front gate to my house makes a creek as I pull on it's cold steel frame. I slip around the side of my house and go through the back door so I don’t wake up my parents. I walk slowly up the stairs and walk into my room, the door already open. </p>

<p>I shut the door behind me and collapse onto my soft bed. It is still warm as I didn’t turn off the electric blanket. I use my feet to take my shoes off and I climb back into bed. I stare at my clock, it’s 07:30, I should probably sleep, I didn’t sleep at all last night. Sleep has become too hard for me lately. I ponder life as my consciousness starts to fade…</p>

<p>“Illuna!” I hear my mother's voice call. “It’s four o’clock, you should get up soon!” </p>

<p>I check my clock and fall back asleep. Some hours later I wake up again, someone is standing at my bed. I look up to see a tall girl with long brown hair who looks about twenty. </p>

<p>“Illuna,” She whispers softly, her voice lulling “Wake up.” </p>

<p>I sit up and rub my eyes to see my little sister standing next to my bed. She didn't knock, again, but her company makes me pleased. </p>

<p>"Good morning Irene," I say smiling, she leans over and hugs me. </p>

<p>"It's dinner time Illuna." </p>

<p>She gives me her shy smile and grasps my wrist gently with her smooth hands, tugging it as I climb out of bed. She doesn't let go and starts walking me down the stairs. She leads me to the dining table where my parents are seated and my food is waiting. Everyone starts eating. I stare down at my soup, I don’t feel like eating. I’m hungry but I just can’t. I want to eat so bad. After everyone is finished my bowl is almost full. </p>

<p>“You didn’t eat much Illuna,” My mother says. </p>

<p>“I’m not hungry,” I reply, getting up from my seat and walking out to my room. </p>

<p>“Illuna get back here.” </p>

<p>I groan and half turn to face my mother. She sighs and waves her hand to let me go. I fall back onto my bed, my hair gets in the way of my face and I can’t see anything. I stay like this for a few minutes before getting off my bed and sitting down at my piano. As I start playing I forget everything that is happening and become immersed in the music. </p>

<p>I continue practising late into the night before I finally get bored. I think about that girl I saw standing next to my bed, is that what Irene will look like when she's older? Is it what I'll look like? Maybe I am just going crazy. I climb into bed hoping to get a few hours sleep. I have a dream where I’m being held by a tall guy. I feel comfortable, safe. Feelings I never feel. I slowly wake up and find myself in the park, I don’t remember coming here. I look around perplexed and check my watch, six o’clock. This isn’t the first time I’ve woken up here, I just don't understand why it keeps happening.</p> 

<p>I see those same ducks from yesterday and flinch. I still can’t face them. I get up and walk back home, collapse onto my bed and sleep. I repeat this process for two weeks. I know, I don’t do much with my life, It’s the same thing over and over, I do mix things up sometimes when I feel like it of course. </p>

<p>It’s the last day of break. I have to stay awake all day so I can sleep normally tomorrow. It’s midday, I’ve been awake for nineteen hours. I struggle to keep my eyes open. I sit at my computer and play video games for a few hours. My eyes hurt a lot. I open my desk drawer, grab some lens cleaner, take my glasses off, and spray the lens cleaner onto them. I rub my glasses with my shirt and put them back on. At six o’clock I crash onto my bed and fall asleep. </p>

<p>As always I am woken up by Irene and told dinner is ready. My parents don’t even tell her to do it, she just does. I’m not sure why she hasn’t stopped caring about me, for the past two years I’ve isolated myself, I avoid my family. Sometimes I wish she would stop being nice to me, I don’t deserve it. I go and collect my bowl of dinner and ask my parents if I can eat it in my room. My mum sighs and reluctantly lets me go. </p>

<p>I don’t eat much of my dinner and I somehow wake up early the next morning, my dinner still on my desk. I have a shower, get dressed, shove my things into my bag and walk out the door. I feel scared that I have to see my friends again, I absolutely don’t want to see them. I want to be alone but I’m scared of feeling lonely. </p>

<p>I make it through the school day by avoiding my friends as much as possible. Instead of eating lunch where I normally do, I sit in a corner by myself. I see people walk past me, people with friends, boyfriends, girlfriends and here I am with no one. The worst part is I could easily go back to my friends and it would be fine, but I don’t want them to know I’m sad. If no one was around I’d cry right now but people would see me. A few people I sort of know walk past and ask me how I'm going. I smile and tell them that I’m fine and of course they smile back and walk off. </p>

<p>In art class, I have to sit through listening to the popular girls talk about absolute shit. They say stuff that no one cares about. They tease me for being silent. At one point one talks about how depressed she is. I want so badly to yell at her. She doesn’t know how good she has it. So what if your boyfriend isn’t in one class? That doesn’t make you depressed. If you were actually depressed, you would hide it, you wouldn’t brag about it or announce it to the world. Why can’t you be grateful for what you have? Why do you think mental illness is something to brag about?</p>

<p>After school, I go to the usual spot in the park and do what I’ve wanted to do for a while, cry. It’s just small tears, I can’t get that much out, but it's enough for now soon enough I’ll be able to get it out. That evening as I sit on the piano I wonder what song to play. I’ve never thought about what song to play before, I normally just play it. I fall onto my bed and I open up my laptop to see I have a message from my friend. </p>

<p>“y werent u @ school 2day? u k?”</p>

<p>I think about what to say back to them. </p>

<p>“I was sick, that’s all.” </p>

<p>I see that all of my friends are in a video call together, they didn’t ask me if I wanted to join. I would have rejected them anyway, but I feel so betrayed. I feel like they don’t care even though we were all close. I’m not sure why I even care, I’m the one who wanted to isolate myself from them but it just makes me hate them. </p>

<p>I start to wonder, maybe everything I’m feeling is self-inflicted. Maybe there’s a part of me that wants to be lonely. Some hours later I decide to talk to my friends online. They all ask if I’m okay and I actually decide to tell them how I feel. I tell them how I think my problems aren’t real, how I don’t deserve their help, how I feel as if I’m wasting their time. They all tell me they care, but they only say that because they have to. Why should anyone care about me? I tell them how much I hate myself and they praise me, they tell me that I’m not worthless. </p>

<p>The only way to get people to compliment me is to insult myself. I point out all the flaws in myself and they tell me I’m not what I say I am. I do believe all the bad things I’m saying about myself are true but not to the level I tell them. I feel bad wasting their time like that. What if part of me is doing this for attention? Getting help that is. I hate attention but I also crave it. All I want is the attention of one person and I want all of it. I don’t deserve someone's full attention though. There is only one thing certain in my life now: I am not needed as everyone has better friends  than me. </p>

<p>I put my laptop down and slowly fall back asleep. I have this weird feeling when I’m asleep, I feel safe, I feel as if I’m being held. I only see darkness but I know someone is holding me. It takes everything I’ve got not to wake up, I don’t want to let go of this feeling. I have this sensation everytime I sleep, which is why I love sleeping so much, but maybe I won’t have to fall asleep to feel loved one day. </p>
