<h1>Chatper Three - a2 </h1>
<p>"That's a brave choice of you Quin… She's uhhhh… Interesting.." </p>

<p>"She sounds like she must be intelligent." </p>

<p>"She is but she's not that nice." </p>

<p>"What's her name?" </p>

<p>"Cyra" </p>

<p>"Cyra…" </p>

<p>"Anyway Quin, I have to return to the Angelic Realm now but I'll return when you wake up okay?" </p>

<p>Quin nodded as Emela grabbed Quin's body, hugging him, Quin still not used to this. Emela's body slowly faded, just as she had appeared before him hours earlier. Quin had trouble sleeping as so many thoughts filled his head. Everything had just been so bizarre. </p>

<p>All he wanted to do was see Emela again, for her to comfort him. She was intelligent and beautiful but above all, her kindness was exactly what Quin needed. He almost had a little crush on her. </p>

<p> * * *</p>

<p>Quin woke up early the next morning and he felt some sort of warm glow at the foot of his bed. Rubbing his eyes, he looked up to see Emela, standing there, smiling. </p>

<p>"Em- Emela…?" </p>

<p>"Good morning Quin," Emela said softly "Are you ready to go out today?" </p>

<p>"I think." </p>

<p>"Good." </p>

<p>Quin tossed his bedsheets in front of him, yawning as he stood up. After realising Emela was still there, he blushed, covering up his body. Emela turned her head, allowing Quin to wake up and get dressed. </p>

<p>"Let's have breakfast," Quin said, walking out of his bedroom.</p>

<p>Emela followed, sitting down at the kitchen counter. Quin began cooking, filling the air with the smell of food. Quin hadn't actually cooked for a few months, the last time he had, Cataline was still alive. He was only cooking because he had a girl in his house. </p>

<p>"So where does Cyra live?" </p>

<p>"The Angelic Realm of course, but I know that's not what you meant. Each of us angels has a place somewhere that has a barrarior around it, making it impossible for other angels to find us unless we're followed." </p>

<p>"Does that mean… Cataline had a place and never showed me…?" </p>

<p>"Quin, why do you think the night Cataline died, no angel was able to find you here and kill you?" </p>

<p>Quin didn't say anything but seemed to understand what Emela was getting at. </p>

<p>"Oh, you understand? Well, there's a barrarior around the house, set up by Cataline herself, silently protecting you. Angels aren't going to detect you when you're in this barrarior and they can only enter on your own volition." </p>

<p>"How come the barrarior is linked to me? I'm not an angel." </p>

<p>"Because when Cataline set up the barrarior, she made it work on you as well." </p>

<p>Learning this, Quin felt a little warm inside. </p>

<p>"So let's say I let an angel in here and I want them to leave?" </p>

<p>"Then they shall be forced back into the Angelic Realm but they'll still know where to find you. Angels can't notice other angels' barriers unless they try to enter them so they wouldn't otherwise know where they are but once they find out, they can set up a counter field to destroy it. That's why you need to be very careful about whom you let inside Quin." </p>

<p>Emela stopped talking as Quin served breakfast and they both remained silent until their plates were clear. Emela stood up once finished, thanking Quin for the meal. They both stepped outside, awkwardly walking down the quiet road.</p> 

<p>“Where are we meeting this angel exactly?” </p>

<p>“We have a sort of shrine where the source of most of the material realms Angelic Energy is generated, we’ll meet her there.” </p>

<p>“The source of the world’s Angelic Energy is located in this city?”</p>

<p>“Well, why do you think we all hang around this city?”</p>

<p>“I guess the closer you are to it, the stronger it is…? Something like that anyway.” </p>

<p>Quin blushed, hiding his face in his hands. He realised the question was not one Emela expected an answer to and he was afraid of being wrong, especially considering that an angel must know considerably more than a human. He had always thought Cataline had an unhuman-like intelligence. </p>

<p>“You’re exactly right Quin, maybe one day you’ll be able to learn Angelic Magic too.” </p>

<p>“You mean… I can learn that…?” </p>

<p>“Being touched by an angel comes with a few advantages…” </p>

<p>Emela blushed, her tone indicating that she was going to finish her sentence but didn’t. </p>

<p>“What do you mean… touched…?”</p>

<p>“Shhhhh don’t ask… I’ll explain another time…” </p>

<p>Emela’s long hair had constantly been getting in her face due to the wind and she had been flicking it back behind her shoulders but she chose instead to hide behind it, not showing Quin how heavy she was blushing. They continued walking through the empty roads of the residential area of the city, not saying a word to each other. </p>

<p>“I’ll ask Cyra then.” </p>

<p>“NOO.” </p>

<p>Emela almost screamed when she said this, much unlike how she normally spoke, softly and calmly. Quin knew that something must have been up.”</p>

<p>“Wh- What is it…?” </p>

<p>“Well… sigh… When I say touch I mean…” </p>

<p>Emela couldn’t bring herself to say it outloud, shaking her head as she finished speaking. </p>

<p>“It’s just… The kind of touch we’re talking about, you probably don’t want to be touched in that kind of way by the Angel of Dominance, because she isn’t afraid to. Anyone but her.” </p>

<p>Quin froze, realising what she had meant. How did she know about what he had done with Cataline? The idea of it made him uncomfortable. </p>

<p>“Okay Quin, we’re almost there… Just, don’t say anything unless spoken to and make sure to look awake the whole time. Oh and don’t show any signs of weakness, she’ll exploit that.” </p>

<p>“You angels sure have trust issues don’t you?” </p>

<p>“It’s not that… It’s just… Most angels aren’t so kind to humans. Well, I wouldn’t say they aren’t kind to them, they just don’t like them a whole lot.” </p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Humans are… annoying. Very annoying. Even I can’t stand most of them.” </p>

<p>Quin felt a little upset by this, he didn’t think someone as sweet as Emela would say anything like that but at the same time, he realised he also couldn’t stand most humans either. </p>

<p>The hill they were walking up slowly became steeper and steeper, leading toward a park at the top, densely filled with tall trees. Quin hadn’t been to this part of the city before, the back part where all the hills and mountains are didn’t exactly have the best reputation. At the top of the hill was a large lattice iron gate with two lions mounted on pillars on either side. The gates were locked and the wall around the park was too high to climb over. </p>

<p>“What do we do…?” Quin asked, his chest slightly burning. </p>

<p>“Nothing, it’s meant to be locked, as soon as an angel enters, the gates shut.” </p>

<p>“You can open them though, right?” </p>

<p>Emela smiled, placing her hand on the quartz block that divided the two parts of the gates. Emela said something to herself that didn’t sound like any language Quin had heard before. A blue light formed, quickly running across the edge of the gate. A strong wind came up from behind, blasting the gates open, a rush of light following through. Emela grabbed Quin’s hand and ran through the entrance. The gates swiftly slammed shut with so much force, one would think it’d be enough to kill anyone it collected with it. </p>

<p>The path within the gates was made of something that resembled marble although it wasn’t anything Quin had seen before. The seams throughout it behaved like aurora, glowing and dancing beneath their feet and it didn’t seem like a solid object, yet it was. The path turned into an intersection meeting up with another path. The area around it resembling something like a town square. The aurora in each of the four paths was a different colour and where they met was a quartz altar with four tall pillars on the edge. </p>

<p>Sitting on the steps leading up to the altar was a girl, grinning at Quin and Emela, although her thick hair covered her eyes, not allowing for any eye contact. Her body was slim and she was small but something about her made her seem as if she was more powerful than everyone she was ever around. </p>

<p>“I got your letter Emela,” She said condescendingly. </p>

<p>“I can tell Cyra,” Emela responded, frowning. </p>

<p>“Why do you feel the need to bring a disgusting human into my presence? What would be so special about him to deserve the privilege of setting his weak eyes onto me?” </p>

<p>Cyra stood up, stepping back onto the step above her, making sure her head was higher than Quin and Emela’s. </p>

<p>“Okay… He’s handsome, I’ll give you that.” </p>

<p>“He’s not like most humans, Cyra.” </p>

<p>“Oh? Why’s that?” </p>

<p>Emela took a step forward, whispering something into Cyra’s ear. It was still loud enough for Quin to hear but he couldn’t understand a word of it. It sounded like the language he had heard Emela speak before. Cyra laughed slightly at what Emela told her. </p>

<p>“Oh, I see. In that case, I might be able to make an exception.” </p>

<p>Cyra paced toward Quin, grinning creepily at him, still covering her eyes behind her hair. Quin took a step back but she still tried to chase after him.</p> 

<p>“Come back here human,” She said, trying to grab him.</p>

<p>“Cyra, not yet. It’s too early for that.” </p>

<p>“Too early for what!?” Quin asked, sounding distraight. </p>

<p>“It’s not too early Emela, the sooner we do this the better.” </p>

<p>“It’s not as powerful if he isn’t willing to Cyra, you know that.” </p>

<p>“I know but-” </p>

<p>“You can’t be that desperate. We can wait.” </p>

<p>“What if Cecelia gets to him first? What if he likes it?” </p>

<p>“Can someone please just tell me what the hell is going on!?” </p>

<p>Emela and Cyra looked back at Quin, who stood there, eyeing them both off. Cyra flicked a clump of her hair behind her ear, showing one of her eyes to Quin. It was a beautiful green colour, like a lush piece of grass after weeks of rain. </p>

<p>“You see Quin, Angels are incapable of directly giving power to each other, there’s only one way we can do that.” </p>

<p>“Cyra, don’t tell him.” </p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“We aren’t ready to tell him that yet. You need to stay patient, okay?” </p>

<p>Quin didn’t feel comfortable knowing that there was something Emela wasn’t willing to tell him, maybe she couldn’t be trusted after all. He started to get a sick feeling in his stomach and his heart was racing.</p> 

<p>“Tell me.” </p>

<p>“Quin-” </p>

<p>“JUST FUCKING TELL ME EMELA!” Quin yelled, cutting Emela off. </p>

<p>Both Quin and Emela looked as if they were about to cry, Cyra on the other hand found it rather amusing to watch. </p>

<p>“Remember what I said before Quin? About being touched by an angel?” </p>

<p>“Y- Yeah…?” </p>

<p>“Well like I said before, you will be able to learn Angelic Magic if you do so or when you die, rather than your soul being destroyed, it’ll be sent to the Angelic Realm, and there are more things that we won’t get into.” </p>

<p>“Just to be clear, when you say being touched by an angel…?” </p>

<p>“Yes, I am refering to sexual intercourse.” </p>

<p>Quin gulped. </p>

<p>“Well, when that happens, power is transferred into you from that angel but power in you is also transferred into that angel. Each angel has a completely separate kind of energy inside them, flowing around and you can think of that energy like blood. The only way for us to share our power and become stronger is through a human.” </p>

<p>“S- So… That’s all you want me for then? So I wasn’t special after all?” </p>

<p>“Quin we could have chosen any human for this but we chose you. You are special and Cataline saw that in you.” </p>

<p>“Actually Cataline was an idiot but still…” Cyra interetuped. </p>

<p>“Not the time Cyra,” Emela said looking upset.</p>

<p>“Not as bad as Cecelia.” </p>

<p>Quin collapsed to the ground, bursting into tears. Quin felt ashamed about letting himself get used by Emela and how he started having a crush on her as soon as he saw her. He felt a familiar warm sensation entangle his body and pulling him toward it. He wanted so badly to shove her away and scream at her but he just didn’t have the heart to. </p>

<p>“Quin I… I’m really sorry I didn’t tell you sooner but, I didn’t want to tell you about it all too soon but I promise we aren’t using you and we really do need you. We want to protect you from the other angels who don’t care about you and just want to use you for their own gains, the same angels who murdered Cataline.” </p>

<p>Once again, Quin wasn’t sure what to do. He could cut ties completely with Emela and Cyra or if he should stay with him. Maybe being found by the other angels wouldn’t be so bad after all. Perhaps Emela and Cyra were the evil ones after all. Quin looked into Emela’s golden eyes, trying to work out if her intentions were good or not. That’s what he had always done, he was always good at looking into people's eyes and just… Working them out. </p>
