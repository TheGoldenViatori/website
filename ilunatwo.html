<h1>Chapter Two - The Allure of Rage</h1>
  
<p>I sit down with my friends at school. They keep going on about who is dating who, quietly ignoring me, who shall always be single. We all know who is with who, everyone you are talking about is right here, what do you expect to gain from this conversation that you have every fucking day? For some reason, they expect me to care about all of their relationships, they complain to me about their relationships instead of being grateful for what they have, for what I’ll never have. </p>

<p>I feel resentment surrounding me. Lately, I’ve been angry more often than I’m sad. Maybe it’s a realisation, that I’ll always be alone? I feel anger and hate towards everything & everyone. When I think about each person, I don’t hate them but together, I despise them all. The only person I don’t hate no matter what I think is Irene. She’s so innocent and nice, I have this feeling of wanting to protect her, even if I can’t protect myself.</p>

<p>On my way home from school, I walk past the duck pond. The same two ducks are swimming with each other through the cold water. It’s bittersweet. I’m happy for the ducks but I know I’ll never have someone to swim through the cold ocean of life with. The boy I love will never swim with me, all because of the senseless decisions I made. </p>

<p>We had dated each other before, the only time in my life I was actually happy was when I was by his side. I was paranoid I would lose him, that I wouldn’t be able to spend my life with him, that he wouldn’t be holding my hand as I took my final breath. This paranoia made me act in ways I’m ashamed of, I said things I shouldn’t have and made everything worse. </p>

<p>I was frightened he didn’t love me or that he loved me for the wrong reasons. I kept bringing it up which was stressful for him, so he ended it. At the time, we hadn’t seen each other for a week, I was having horrible separation anxiety from not being able to be with him. It’s only looking at the ducks I realise what I did wrong back then and now, I’m furious. </p>

<p>I want to kill the ducks, I want to pull them out of the water and violently tear their wings off. I want to destroy all the love in the world. If I can’t have it, I don’t want anyone else to have it either. As I walk home, awful and disgusting thoughts fill my head. I’m faced with everything I’ve done wrong in my life and the anger inside me spirals out of control. I check my watch, four o’clock. My parents won’t be home this weekend and my sister will be at her friend’s house. If I don’t make it home, no one will notice.</p> 

<p>I walk out of town into the forest. The narrow trail and the tall trees give me chills. The forest is scary but I want to punish myself for thinking all of these thoughts. As it gets darker, I’m pushed more and more into my mind. I have more flashbacks and more vile thoughts. It would be easy to bring a gun to school and shoot everyone, my grandfather lives on a farm our in the bush, I could take his rifle from his shed, if I run it only takes twenty minutes to get to his place. </p>

<p>It would be easy to do a lot of deplorable things, to others and myself. Finally, I reach breaking point. I run at the nearest tree and start tearing the branches off. I punch it and kick it. My hands bleed but I don’t stop. I tear the branches off so recklessly that I cut my legs and abdomen to the point where it hurts to stand. I keep standing though, I’m not done yet. I kick up the ground. I bruise my feet from kicking stones and I choke on the dust that fills my lungs. </p>

<p>I stagger clumsily away from the path and collapse to the ground. I know I’ll be here until the morning so I crawl across the ground so that no one finds me if they are walking along the path. As I crawl, rocks and sticks that lie on the ground cut my body. My shirt is full of holes and soaked in blood. My jacket is tied around my waist so it’s not in the worst condition. </p>

<p>I find myself in a bush, I’m coughing, bleeding and freezing all at the same time. Part of me hopes I’ll die. I know that I’ll never be happy again. But part of me tells me that if I keep going, life will work out. Before I can think, I find myself falling asleep. </p>

<p>When I wake up, it’s still night. I can’t see my watch as it’s too dark but it is around 3 or 4. I find the strength to stand. I reach into the pocket of my jacket (still tied around my waist) and fumble around for my phone. 03:42. I use the flashlight to find my way back up to the path and out of the forest. I turn off the flashlight as I approach town and the faint street lights guide my way. </p>

<p>I stumble into my house and upstairs to my room. I take all of my blood-soaked clothes off revealing myriads of cuts, bruises and scratches. I decide to take a shower to clean all the blood and dirt off myself. I think about everything that just happened. I only realise now exactly what I just did. </p>

<p>I get out of the shower without drying myself. I walk to my room, water dripping through the hallway. I climb straight into my bed, wet and naked. The sheets soak up the water from my body and I feel calm as if they are soaking up my pain with it. A few hours later I wake up and find myself crying, I have no idea why that would suddenly happen.</p>

<p>I think about how I treated my old boyfriend. I had the sweetest guy on the planet by my side and I was awful to him. I was so selfish, I wanted him all to myself. My actions put me where I am now. He had expectations of me and I didn’t live up to them. After everything I did, a part of me finds myself angry at him. I’m disgusting.</p>

<p>I go downstairs and make myself breakfast. I don’t eat very much, throwing out most of the food. I spend the majority of the day playing video games, not thinking about myself or the outside world. I decide to take a break and have dinner. I haven't eaten all day. At this point, I no longer want to be myself, I want to become a different person.</p>
