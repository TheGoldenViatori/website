<h1>To Desire Affinity</h1>
<p>This is a story I starting writing in mid 2021, when I was going through a pretty rough period of my life. I never finished it and I doubt I'll ever pick it back up again. I could only write it when I was in a pretty bad state of mind but now I'm satisfied with my life. The story was also written as a "Fuck you" to a few people who I don't know anymore and thus don't really have any resenment toward them.</p>
